1.we want to store key value pairs
2.in case of array key is alyas integer
3.a[0/1/2/3]
4.maps->insert(key,value)
      ->getvalue()
      ->deletekey
these are the three functions needed.
5.implemeting hasmaps using ll->already done by me index and value
6.all three have O(n) complexity.
7.another method is by bst.
8.height=logn.
8.insertion,deletion,search all log needed.
9.hash table even better O(1).
