//method 1: sort the array and return->nlogn
//methd2:but we want even less complexity 
//assume first index to be minimum then add k-1 more elements which are min than the previously added then travers the left over array and replace the largest of k-1 elemnts if min than first added is found
//it will be in n complexity
